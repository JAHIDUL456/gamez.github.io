   <b style="font-size: 30px;">A</b> game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool.[1] Games are different from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).

Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player. A toy and a game are not the same. Toys generally allow for unrestricted play whereas games come with present rules.

<p>A Game Engine (game environment) is a specialized development environment for creating video games. The features one provides depends on the type and the granularity of control allowed by the underlying framework. Some may provide diagrams, a windowing environment and debugging facilities. Users build the game with the game IDE, which may incorporate a game engine or call it externally. Game IDEs are typically specialized and tailored to work with one specific game engine.

    This is in distinction from domain-specific entertainment languages, where all is needed is a text editor. They are distinct from integrated development environments which are more general, and may provide different sets of features.
    
    There is also a distinction from Visual programming language in that programming languages are more general than Game Engines.</p>
